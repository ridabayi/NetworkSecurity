### Network Security Projects For PhisingData
This project is about ingesting and processing data securely.
# 🔐 NetworkSecurity Pipeline

NetworkSecurity is a modular and production-ready pipeline for building, validating, encrypting, and securely deploying sensitive communications or models in a cybersecurity context. Inspired by MLOps practices, the project is organized as an end-to-end system, from data ingestion to cloud deployment, following best DevSecOps principles.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- Modular architecture inspired by TFX/MLOps pipelines.
- Ingests data from a MongoDB database.
- Validates and transforms raw data before processing.
- Includes encryption scripts for secure messaging.
- Supports secure deployment to Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Traceability of every stage through versioned artifacts.

## ⚙️ Pipeline Overview

The pipeline is composed of the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Connects to a MongoDB database to collect raw data and export it as ingestion artifacts.

2. **Data Validation**  
   Ensures consistency, schema conformity, and filters invalid or malicious entries.

3. **Data Transformation**  
   Applies preprocessing steps such as encoding, normalization, or custom formatting for secure messaging or model training.

4. **Model Training** *(optional)*  
   Trains a model if required by the use case (e.g., anomaly detection, intrusion classification).

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Verifies if the logic/model meets acceptance thresholds before deployment.

6. **Model Pusher (Deployment)**  
   Deploys the final artifact to cloud storage or secure infrastructure (AWS S3, Azure Blob, GCP Bucket).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ridabayi/NetworkSecurity.git
cd NetworkSecurity
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need:

- Python 3.8+
- `openssl` installed
- Access to MongoDB database (cloud/local)

### 3. Configure the Pipeline

Edit the files in `config/` to match your environment:

- MongoDB URI, collection names
- Encryption keys or certificate paths
- Thresholds and evaluation logic
- Deployment credentials

### 4. Run the Pipeline

```bash
python run.py
```

This triggers all stages in order and saves each component’s artifacts under `artifacts/`.

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

Encrypt and send a secure message:

```bash
python src/transformation/secureMail.py --encrypt -i input.txt -o output.enc
./src/deployment/sendMail.sh output.enc recipient@example.com
```

Clean up temporary and encrypted files:

```bash
./src/deployment/cleanUp.sh
```

---

## ☁️ Deployment Options

- ✅ AWS S3 (via boto3)
- ✅ Azure Blob Storage
- ✅ Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- ⏳ Custom REST API or SCP push supported in future versions

---

## 📂 Artifacts

Each component saves its outputs in `artifacts/`, enabling traceability and reproducibility:

- `ingestion/`: Raw data dump
- `validation/`: Validation logs, error reports
- `transformation/`: Cleaned/encrypted files
- `evaluation/`: Model performance or approval
- `deployment/`: Uploaded records, paths, logs

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Academic research in network or cybersecurity
- Penetration testing automation (e.g., encrypted payloads)
- Secure message workflows for defense or sensitive industries
- Educational demonstrations of MLOps architecture applied to security
